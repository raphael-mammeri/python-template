Voila @voila
Docker is a platform that enables developers to easily create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that contain all the necessary dependencies and libraries for an application to run.

Docker uses a technology called containerization, which allows developers to package an application and its dependencies into a single container. This makes it easy to deploy the application on any machine that has Docker installed, regardless of the underlying operating system or infrastructure.

Docker also provides a centralized repository for sharing and distributing containers, called the Docker Hub. This allows developers to easily share their containers with others and use containers created by others in their own projects.

Docker has several advantages over traditional virtualization, including:

    * **Lightweight:** Containers are much smaller in size compared to virtual 
    machines, which makes them faster to start and stop.
      * **Portability:** Containers can run on any machine that has Docker installed, 
        making it easy to move applications between different environments.
      * **Isolation:** Containers provide a level of isolation between applications, 
        which can prevent conflicts and crashes.
      * **Scalability:** Docker makes it easy to scale applications horizontally by 
        running multiple containers on multiple machines.

Overall, Docker is a powerful tool that allows developers to easily create, deploy, and manage applications in a containerized environment. It has been widely adopted by organizations of all sizes and is used in many different industries.
